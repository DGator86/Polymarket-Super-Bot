# Kalshi Bot - Server List for Multi-Deployment
# Add one server per line in the format: user@hostname
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Example entries (replace with your actual VPS details):
# ubuntu@vps1.example.com
# root@192.168.1.100
# trader@vps2.yourdomain.com
# deploy@10.0.0.50

# Tips:
# - Ensure SSH key-based authentication is set up for passwordless deployment
# - The user should have sudo access for systemd service installation
# - Python 3.8+ must be installed on each server
